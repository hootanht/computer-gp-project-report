# Computer Graphics Project Report

## Description
This project aims to improve the prediction of cloud point images under various weather conditions. The project uses a multi-weather conditions dataset and modifies some models to get a weather mask as another input. The results show that models can predict better when the camera image is distorted. These findings suggest that model prediction cannot be better in some weather conditions, but it can help reduce camera distortion.
